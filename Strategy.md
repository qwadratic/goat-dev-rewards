# Dev Engagement Strategy: NFT Checkpoints & Speedruns

## 1. "Build-to-Earn" Challenge

📌 **Idea**: Let’s get devs to create their own NFT reward mechanics, tweak them, make something fun, and just compete on who builds the coolest on-chain achievement system.

### 🔹 How it Works?
- Fork the demo project, add your own logic for earning NFTs (maybe a new type of badge, maybe something else, up to the devs).
- The best contributions get bounties

🎯 **Why?**: Instead of just reading docs, devs actually *do* stuff and explore the chain.

## 2. Speedrun Mode: Racing for Legendary NFTs

📌 **Let's make coding feel like a competition** — introducing periodic Speedruns where devs race to hit certain milestones first.

### 🔹 The plan:
- Speedruns are time-limited. First one to hit, let’s say, **10 unique users on their contract**, gets a rare NFT.
- Only one winner per event. No second place.
- Creates a fun race, something to actually **do**, instead of just launching another boring test contract.

📌 **DevRel & Marketing Need to Sync Up:**
- **DevRel:** Makes sure everything actually works, provides docs, support, tutorials.
- **Marketing:** Hypes it up, gets ppl interested, pushes engagement.
- When both work together, we get way more traction.

🎯 **Why?** Amplifies DevRel initiatives with Marketing support

## 3. Content That Actually Helps

📌 **Instead of generic “How to use our SDK” guides, let’s make content that actually matters to devs.**

### 🔹 Stuff to make:
- **“How to Add On-Chain Badges to Your Web3 App (In 30 min, no BS).”**
- **Short video breakdowns** (backend, frontend, contracts, real quick, no fluff).
- **Blog posts on actual usecases** (not just “NFTs are cool”, but how to make them *useful*).

🎯 **Why?** Devs don't wanna read 20 pages of docs. Give them **fast, actionable** content they can use.

---

## 4. Making Devs *Want* to Deploy Stuff

📌 **Gamification is a proven community amplifier. Let's turn GOAT Testnet3 into a playground.**

### 🔹 How?
- **Deploy something? Get a badge.**
- **Hit some milestone? More badges.**
- **Leaderboard** with top contributors—turn it into a game.

🎯 **Why?** No one cares about just deploying a contract. But if you turn it into a game? Yeah, that changes things.

---

## 5. GitHub Challenges & Bounties

📌 **If devs are already building, let’s get them contributing too.**

### 🔹 How?
- Open GitHub issues with fun challenges (like “optimize this contract” or “add custom NFT attributes”).
- Reward PRs with GOAT tokens or exclusive NFTs.
- Best solutions get merged. Simple as that.

🎯 **Why?** Makes it easier to pull devs into the ecosystem. And once they contribute, they tend to stick around.

NFT-based achievements + Speedrun events = **more engagement, more fun, more ppl actually shipping stuff.**
